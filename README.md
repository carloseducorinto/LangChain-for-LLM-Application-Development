# L1_Model_prompt_parser.ipynb 

## LangChain: Models, Prompts, and Output Parsers

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to interact with language models using the LangChain framework. The notebook covers the following topics:

- Direct API calls to OpenAI
- API calls through LangChain:
  - Prompts
  - Models
  - Output parsers

## Setup

To get started, you need to install the required packages and set up your OpenAI API key.

### Installation

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
pip install openai
```

What is Router Langchain

Router Langchain are created to manage and route prompts based on specific conditions. They can be used to create complex workflows and give more control over how the AI model’s response.

## LangChain: Chain Implementation

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to implement chains using the LangChain framework. The notebook covers the following topics:

- Setting up the LangChain environment
- Implementing chain mechanisms
- Examples of using chains in language model interactions

## Setup

To get started, you need to install the required packages and set up your OpenAI API key.

### Installation

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install langchain openai google-search-results
```
