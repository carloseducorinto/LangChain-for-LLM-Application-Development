# L1_Model_prompt_parser.ipynb 

## LangChain: Models, Prompts, and Output Parsers

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to interact with language models using the LangChain framework. The notebook covers the following topics:

- Direct API calls to OpenAI
- API calls through LangChain:
  - Prompts
  - Models
  - Output parsers

## Setup

To get started, you need to install the required packages and set up your OpenAI API key.

### Installation

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
pip install openai
```
